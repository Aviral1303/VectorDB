## ðŸ”„ Change Log (recent)
- Added KDTree and LSH indexes; index factory updated
- Wired IndexService for background rebuilds and version sync
- Added QueryService with stale policy and filtered brute-force path
- Implemented EmbeddingService (Cohere/local) and updated schemas/routers
- Fixed delete endpoints to strict 204 compliance
- Added global exception handlers
- Added optional JSON persistence via app lifespan
- Wrote concise README with run/demo steps

---

## ðŸš¨ Remaining Work (per rules2.mdc)
- README: finalize design/complexity notes and demo script pointers (short)
- Docker validation: build/run locally; add note if daemon unavailable
- Optional: Python SDK (thin client) [nice-to-have]

---

## âš¡ Next Actions
1. Finalize README (index complexities, concurrency summary)
2. Validate Docker build/run on local machine; document
3. Optional: add tiny SDK client (if time allows)

---

## âœ… Test Summary
- All tests passing: `pytest -q` â†’ green
- Manual smoke verified full flow: CRUD â†’ index build (bf/kd_tree/lsh) â†’ query (embedding/text) â†’ stale rebuild
